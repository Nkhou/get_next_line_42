# get_next_line

📋 Overview
get_next_line is a custom C function that reads content line by line from a file descriptor. This implementation handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously and efficiently manages memory, making it ideal for parsing file content in C programs.
✨ Features

Line-by-Line Reading - Efficiently extract individual lines from files
Multiple File Descriptor Support - Read from different files concurrently
Memory Efficiency - Careful allocation and deallocation of resources
Buffer Management - Optimized reading with customizable buffer size
Error Handling - Robust handling of edge cases and errors

📝 Return Values

Line read: A null-terminated string including the newline character \n (if present)
End of file: NULL when all lines have been read
Error: NULL when an error occurs (invalid fd, malloc failure, etc.)

🧠 Implementation Details
The function uses a static variable to keep track of leftover characters from previous reads for each file descriptor. This allows it to efficiently handle multiple files and maintain state between calls.
Key components:

Static buffer: Maintains remaining data between function calls
Dynamic memory allocation: Efficiently manages memory for lines of varying lengths
Buffer size control: Configurable via the BUFFER_SIZE macro
File descriptor validation: Ensures valid input parameters

📊 Performance
The function has been optimized for:

Memory efficiency (minimal allocations)
Reading speed (appropriate buffer sizing)
Resource management (no memory leaks)
